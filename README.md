# about me

My name is Gabriel Amoroso, and it's a pleasure to have you interested in my repositories! I work mainly with Python, but I'm familiar with SQL and R as well. 
My primary focus fow now is data analysis (pre-processing, statistics and ETL) and data visualization (Tableau and Power BI), but I still have room for improvements on those areas and I do want to learn about new tools and technologies. 

Also, as a pharmacist I'm crazy about genomics and biotechnology. I got into programming world while researching about genetics diseases, and I fell in love when i discovered Bioinformatics. I made an essay about it during my last year in college with the title "Drug Repositioning for Schizophrenia using Network Medicine", where I identified relevant genes in schizophrenia and explored the possibility of using other drugs for the treatment of the disease, using R language.

And finally I did an online bootcamp on Data Analysis by TripleTen, where I could develop more skills on that field to pursue my new professional objective, that is merge my Pharmacist background with love for technology and analytics.
